**The Morning Manifesto**:  
*"We reject the false choice between performance and expressiveness.  
We reject the old methods imposed by backward compatibility with
long-dead legacy products. Morning is a new era in programming
that combines the simplicity of S-expressions with the functionality
of C++. Thanks to the purity of the project and its versatility,
you can create anything and everything you want."*
